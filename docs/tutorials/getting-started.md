# Getting started

Goal: clone the workspace, run the devcontainer, bootstrap every CFT repo, and have a working cross-repo grep — in under 10 minutes.

## 1. Prerequisites

- A GitHub account with access to the `hmcts` organisation.
- An SSH key uploaded to GitHub. Test: `ssh -T git@github.com` should print "Hi <username>! You've successfully authenticated…".
- VS Code with the **Dev Containers** extension, or the Docker CLI.
- (For HMCTS-internal hostnames) the F5 VPN. Connect **before** opening the devcontainer to avoid the DNS resolution issue.

## 2. Clone and open

```bash
git clone git@github.com:hmcts/cft-workspace.git
cd cft-workspace
code .
```

Accept the "Reopen in Container" prompt when VS Code asks. The post-create hook will:

1. Confirm `gh auth status`.
2. Run `./scripts/bootstrap` to clone all manifest entries.
3. Run `./scripts/doctor` and print a summary.

If you're not using VS Code, run those steps yourself on the host.

## 3. First commands

```bash
# Search across every clone.
./scripts/grep "noticeOfChange"

# Sync everything to its remote default branch.
./scripts/sync

# Sync only the nfdiv repos.
./scripts/sync apps/nfdiv

# Add a new repo to the manifest and clone it.
./scripts/add-repo apps/civil/civil-service hmcts/civil-service

# Refresh the workspace index after changes.
./scripts/index
```

## 4. Optional: MCP servers

The workspace ships `atlassian` (Jira + Confluence) and `jenkins` MCP servers. Atlassian needs one browser sign-in via `/mcp`; Jenkins needs a token you create yourself — see [set up the Atlassian and Jenkins MCP servers](../how-to/set-up-mcp-servers.md). Skip this for now if you only need code search.

## 5. First AI-assisted interaction

Start your preferred client from the workspace root. In Claude Code, try one of:

```
/repo-doctor
/cft-tour ccd
/cft-ccd-find-feature notice_of_change
/cft-list-integrations work_allocation
```

In Codex, invoke the equivalent skills with `$`:

```
$repo-doctor
$cft-tour ccd
$cft-ccd-find-feature notice_of_change
$cft-list-integrations work_allocation
```

The first two read static state. The latter two consult `INDEX.md` — if it is empty, the client will offer to run `docs-generate-product-md` first.

## 6. Working inside a clone

`cd` into a specific clone before running build/test commands. Each is its own git repo with its own toolchain — see its `README.md` and any local `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`.

## Common stumbles

- **`scripts/bootstrap` errors with "GitHub SSH auth failed"** → your SSH key isn't on GitHub. Run `ssh-keygen -t ed25519` then upload `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` to GitHub Settings → SSH and GPG keys.
- **`scripts/bootstrap` prints "bootstrap complete" but most repos didn't clone** → on macOS, BSD `xargs -I{}` silently converts the tab-separated manifest fields to spaces, so each entry collapses into one string and creates an empty stub directory instead of cloning. Same trap affects `scripts/sync`. Confirm with `scripts/doctor`, which checks clones are actually present rather than trusting either script's own exit status.
- **AAT hostnames don't resolve** → the F5 VPN started after the devcontainer; rebuild the container or run `.devcontainer/refresh-dns.sh`.
- **`./scripts/sync` skips a repo** → it has dirty changes, is on a non-default branch, or has unpushed commits. That's by design; commit/push/clean first, then re-run.
- **A local clone can be several days behind its remote** → sync is manual and skips anything dirty/branched/unpushed, so a clone can silently drift. Before trusting a clone's content for time-sensitive state (e.g. what's actually live in `platops/cnp-flux-config` before a prod change), check `git log -1` in that clone or compare against GitHub directly.
- **A scripted `docker run ... bash -c` against the devcontainer image reports `command not found` for `node`, `claude` or `codex`** → all three are installed via nvm, which is sourced from the shell's rc file and only runs in an interactive shell. VS Code's integrated terminal is interactive, so this doesn't show up there; a non-interactive invocation needs to source nvm itself first, e.g. `export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm" && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"`.
- **`./scripts/sync` skips many Java clones with "N dirty file(s)", and the dirty files are a `bin/` directory** → a Java language-server extension (e.g. VS Code/Cursor's "Language Support for Java") opened on the workspace root compiles every Gradle project it can find into a `bin/` output directory, which most clones don't gitignore. Check what's actually in `bin/` with `git status`/`git ls-files` before deleting anything — a small number of repos keep real tracked source under `bin/`, so a blanket delete can destroy it.
